# Maze Solver Using C

## Project Description

The **Maze Solver** is a C-based application designed to solve mazes using various pathfinding algorithms. 
It allows users to input a maze, select a preferred algorithm, and displays the optimal path to the goal. 
The project focuses on exploring graph traversal techniques to find the shortest or most efficient route through the maze.

The implementation uses a menu-driven interface for simplicity and provides clear feedback on the chosen algorithm's behavior. 
This project is perfect for learning the inner workings of popular pathfinding algorithms and exploring their real-world applications.

## Features

- Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**:
  - Depth First Search (DFS): Explores paths in a depth-wise manner, useful for traversing all possible routes.
  - Breadth First Search (BFS): Ensures the shortest path in an unweighted maze by exploring all nodes level by level.
  - A*: Uses a heuristic-based approach to find the optimal path quickly.
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Guarantees the shortest path in weighted mazes using cost-based traversal.
- Dynamic Input: Users can input custom maze structures or use default examples.
- User-Friendly Interface: Menu-driven input for selecting algorithms and viewing results.
- Visual Representation: Displays the maze and the optimal path in a clear, understandable format.

## How It Works

1. Maze Representation:
   - The maze is represented as a 2D grid where:
     - `0` represents open paths.
     - `1` represents walls.
     - `S` is the start point.
     - `E` is the endpoint.
2. Algorithm Selection:
   - Users select one of the provided algorithms from the menu.
3. Execution:
   - The selected algorithm processes the maze, determines the path, and returns the result.
4. Output:
   - The solution displays the maze with the shortest path marked.
